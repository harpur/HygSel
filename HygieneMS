# Hygiene Results -------------------

A) Evidence of Selection: Fst and Creeper
	no. sites
	no. regions
	size of regions
	genes in regions
	
	
	#I'd like to include the AF bit. perhaps AF as major control vs minor
	
B) Admxiture
	From Drone Analysis and DronePlots.r
	
	Across the entuire genome, on average both selected and control bees have the same ancestry (C=M), but at sites acted on by selection, Selected bees seem to have purged C lineage ancestry and increased M (but NOT A) lineage ancestry

	This implies that the alleles underpinning hygiene originated or are most closely related to C lineage bees. There is limited evidenc that these bees are the most hygiene, so subspecies comparisons need to come soon. #Interesting bump at 50%? He effects?
	
	
C) Genes and gene networks, etc.

	THough few genes, No evidene of expression bias, some bias towards being old, no or very little overlap with known DEGs and DEPs. 
	
	#involved in TRN/BeeSpace? 
	
	The genes are THESE
	
	There are NSYN changes to THIS MANY and have high FST. As well as indels.
